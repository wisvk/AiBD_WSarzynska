# Laboratorium 5 - TIER protocol i tidy data

Original data earthquake_data.csv is available in /OriginalData folder. It's also copied to /AnalysisData with name changed to earthquake_data_org.

The whole script is in /CommandFiles/dataset.py

Data after analysis is available in /AnalysisData/AnalysisData.csv - file contains all info from earthquake_data_org.csv. I prepared a table merging age, gender and answer the question "Do you think the "Big One" will occur in your lifetime?". Besides, I changed the names of the columns. 

The data from earthquake_data.csv has been sorted and cumulated in script dataset.py
